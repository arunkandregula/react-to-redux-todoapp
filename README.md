## Step8 - Branch. 
08-log-every-state-change

## Step8. 
 1. We will see how to log every state change in the redux app. In Redux app, although we dont have central Dispatcher like in Flux, every state chnage is centralized thru store.dispatch() method.

 2. In this step, we will see how we can override store.dispatch method to log every state change.
    We will also see how to use console.group API for grouping and coloring the logs.

 3. In one of the subsequent steps, we will see how to achieve the same using a npm package. (redux-logger)
